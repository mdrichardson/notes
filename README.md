# Notes

This is just a collection of notes that I've put together covering various programming topics. I didn't start this until 8/10/2018, so it's far from all-inclusive. You may find these helpful, but they're mostly just for me.

**Ignore all of my commit comments. These are just notes, so the commit messages are far less relevant than the diff, which isn't that relevant, either**
