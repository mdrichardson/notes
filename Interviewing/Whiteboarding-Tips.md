# Whiteboarding Tips

* Ask for clarification, repeated
  * Write it out, say it back and verify you understand the problem
* Think out loud constantly. You should pretty much always be talking
  * Gives interviewer opportunity to guide, as well
* Think through everything before writing any code. Be sure you know that your code would work before writing it
* Test your solution
* Think about edge cases (empty inputs, duplications, etc)
  * Edge cases for strings might include:
    * Case
    * Number instead of string
    * Spaces, dashes, etc
    * Accented characters
