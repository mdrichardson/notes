# Object-Oriented Programming

## 4 Pillars

1. Ecapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Encapsulation

Combine a group of related variables and functions into an Object. Variables are `properties` and functions are `methods`. Reduces complexity and increases reusability.

## Abstraction

Hide the complexity. This makes the interface simpler and reduces the impact of change.

## Inheritance

Allows you to eliminate redundant code.

## Polymorphism

Allows you to get rid of long if/else and switches.
