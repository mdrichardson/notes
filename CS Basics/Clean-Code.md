# Writing Clean Code

1. Use meaningful variable and function names
    * Better to be meaningful than short
2. Code should speak for itself whenever possible
    * Code should be written so that intention is clear
    * Better to be readable than fancy
    * Use comments only when code cannot speak for itself
3. Leave code better than you found it
    * When you're reviewing, improve the code as possible
4. Functions and methods should do one thing and do it well
    * If you're passing many arguments, it's a good indicator that your function does too much and should be broken up
5. Write tests. Use the tests to improve code
