# Testing

What interviewers are looking for when asking about testing:

1. Big Picture Understanding - What is the software really about and how will it be used? What's most important?
2. Knowing How the Pieces Fit Together - How does it integrate with a larger ecosystem?
3. Organization - Are tests logically grouped or just blurted out in any random order?
4. Practicality - Can the tests actually be done and are they useful?

## Testing a Real World Object

1. Who will use it and why?
2. What are the use cases?
3. What are the bounds of use?
4. What are the stress/failure conditions?
5. How would you perform the testing?

## Testing Software

1. Black Box (no access to internal commands) vs. White Box (some access to internal commands)
2. Who will use it and why?
3. What are the use cases?
4. What are the bounds of use?
5. What are the stress/failure conditions?
6. What are the test cases and how would they be performed?

## Testing Functions

1. Define the test cases - Normal, extreme, nulls/illegals, strange inputs
2. Define the expected result
3. Write the test code
