* Asian American should be used separately from Pacific Islanders, when appropriate
* Anti-Asian stems from 1850s Chinese laborers being seen as lesser. Capitalism lead to Chinese laborers being exploited for cheap labor and then hate turned against them for "stealing jobs."

* Magnified now due to Coronavirus, "kung flu", "Chinese flu"
* Asians are rarely seen as "American" regardless of how long they've lived here. They seem to be forever tied to their homeland.
* There's a lot of news lately about Black on Asian violence. Sometimes this is true, but sometimes it's not racially-motivated (i.e. the 85 yo Thai man being killed in San Francisco)
* Anti-Black actions tend to be ongoing (police violence, etc) but anti-Asian seems to be contingent on events (Coronavirus, Pearl Harbor, etc)
    * Since they're different, we should look at them differently instead of lumping them together
* "Crime wave" and "numbers" are usually loaded
    * "150% increase in anti-asian hate crime": 49 in 2019, 122 in 2020. There's 44 million people in those cities, so that's not really a panic-y increase
* Lots of stories shared about overt non-violent racism people have experienced. It was really surprising.
* Recommendations for allyship:
    * reach out to support
    * speak out against it
    * help them practice English by starting conversations
