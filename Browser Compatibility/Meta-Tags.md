# Meta Tags

At a minimum for responsive design, you should include:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

From [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag):

The `width` property controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like `width=600` or to the special value `device-width`, which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. (There are corresponding `height` and `device-height` values, which may be useful for pages with elements that change size or position based on the viewport height.)

The `initial-scale` property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. The `maximum-scale`, `minimum-scale`, and `user-scalable` properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
