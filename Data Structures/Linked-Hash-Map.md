# Linked Hash Map

* Similar to hash map/table, but maintains order of elements inserted
* Elements can be accessed in their insertion order
* Rules:
  * Contains values based on the key. Extends hash map/table
  * Contains only unique elements
  * May have one null key and multiple null values
* Python has this as `collections.OrderedDict`
